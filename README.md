# BlenderX3DSupport

This purpose of this project is to support work by the X3D community to improve capabilities
of import X3D files into Blender and export Blender projects to X3D format files.

Contributors are invited to fork this project, develop X3D support capabilities, and present pull requests to this 
repository. This reposity is administered by the Web3D Consortium (https://www.web3d.org)

Goals / Issues to address:

The Blender exporter distributed with the standard Blender distribution does not support exporting X3D scenes that use image based textures. Neither texture support of X3D v3.3 nor the physically based rendering textures of X3D v4 are supported.
