# BlenderX3DSupport

This purpose of this project is to support work by the X3D community to improve the  importing of X3D files into Blender and exporting Blender projects to X3D  files. This project was cloned from the Blender add-ons repository  git://git.blender.org/blender-addons.git . The Blender Add-On project page is at https://developer.blender.org/diffusion/BA/repository/master/ . The code for the X3D importer and exporter is in directory io_scene_x3d .

Contributors are invited to fork this project, develop X3D support capabilities, and present pull requests to this 
repository. This reposity is administered by the Web3D Consortium (https://www.web3d.org). There are good resources for Blender developers (https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Main_Page) and a coding style guide (https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Style_Guide).

Goals to address:

1. The Blender exporter distributed with the standard Blender distribution does not support exporting X3D scenes that use image based textures. Neither texture support of X3D v3.3 nor the physically based rendering textures of X3D v4 are supported.
